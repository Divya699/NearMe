 Pallavan Nagar in Tiruvannamalai district is a residential area named in honour of the ancient Pallava dynasty,
 which once ruled much of northern Tamil Nadu. The colony was developed in the later 20th century 
 as part of Tiruvannamalai's urban expansion around the famous Arunachaleswarar Temple and the sacred Annamalai Hill. 
 While the name reflects the cultural pride linked to the Pallavas—known for their temple architecture and Tamil heritage—the areas,
 and community facilities serving its residents today.One of Tamil Nadu's most revered spiritual centres. Over the years, Pallavan Nagar
 has grown into a well-connected neighbourhood with schools, small temples, shops, and public amenities. It reflects the blend of
 Tiruvannamalai's rich cultural heritage and the steady modernization of the region.
